How did misinformation get to be so widespread? How is it that so many people are so easily deceived? Is it deliberate self-deception? Stupidity?
<br><br>
Or are all those people just plain evil?

Human beings are remarkably good at self-deception. It seems like we are all batshit crazy. Not only that: each social group, each community, each "tribe" seems to have its own distinct, idiosyncratic brand of crazy.

<br>

In this book, we argue that it is no accident that we are all self-deluded, lying hypocrites.
This trait -- which I refer to as **toxicity** -- is no accident.
It cannot be explained away as failure, weakness, or imperfection. And labelling them evil has no explanatory value.

<br>

As we will argue in this book, toxicity serves a very specific, very important purpose. **We are toxic by design**. Why? Because, as ironic as it may sound,
toxicity is a necessary prerequisite for one of our most basic spiritual and psychological needs:

to belong

Toxicity is not limited to "those people" over there. Toxicity is an integral part of everyone's psyche.
But of course ... most people don't want to admit it!
It applies to The Other ... obviously. But it also applies to me. ***And it applies, dear reader, to you too, whether you want to admit it or not.***

<br>

In this book, we offer an explanation for the above questions. Ironically, it is our need for community, our need for belonging, and our search for virtue that drives these ostensibly anti-virtuous traits.  

<br>

We believe there is a method to the madness. In this book we offer an answer to the above questions. More importantly, this book tells us what we can do about it.
