It is no accident that we are all self-deluded, lying hypocrites. This trait -- which I refer to as **toxicity** -- is no accident.
It cannot be explained away as failure, weakness, or imperfection.

<br>

As I will argue in this book, **we are toxic by design**. Why? Because toxicity is a necessary prerequisite for one of our most basic spiritual needs:

<br>

***to belong.***

<br>

The need to belong to a tribe is fundamental to survival and is one of our deepest needs.
The price that we pay is the narrative fiction: a set of lies, contradictions characterized by unpalatability, a.k.a. toxicity.
This toxic body of lies, incorporated into our lives and into our psyches,
functions as a uniform for our tribal identity. The central observation of this book is that toxicity is not an accident.
The narrative fiction is not a collection of honest mistakes.
The tribal narrative is toxic by design. Toxicity is central the narrative could not serve its purpose.
Toxicity is necessary to discourage infiltrators from donning the uniform.
Donning the narrative is difficult, by design.

<br>

The virtue signal, a litmus test, is a tool to reveal the presence of this uniform. In doing so, it propagates the narrative fiction, and
plays a special role in evolution of the narrative.
To help us accept the narrative fiction, the brain has a special tool: the COGNITIVE BLIND SPOT.
