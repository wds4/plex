The need to belong to a tribe is fundamental to survival and has come through evolution to be one of our deepest psychological needs.
The price that we pay is the narrative fiction: a set of lies and internally inconsistent concepts and beliefs
that come over time to be associated with the tribe.
This toxic body of lies, incorporated into our lives and into our psyches,
functions as a uniform for our tribal identity. The central observation of this book is that toxicity is not an accident.
The narrative fiction is not a collection of honest mistakes.
The tribal narrative is toxic by design. Without toxicity, the narrative could not serve its primary purpose:
to provide a method to distinguish members of the tribe from non-members.
Toxicity is necessary to discourage infiltrators from donning the uniform.
Donning the narrative is difficult, by design.

The virtue signal, a litmus test, is a tool to reveal the presence of this uniform. In doing so, it propagates the narrative fiction, and
plays a special role in evolution of the narrative.
To help us accept the narrative fiction, the brain has a special tool: the COGNITIVE BLIND SPOT.
