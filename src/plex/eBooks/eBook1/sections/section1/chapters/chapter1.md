***A societal narrative (or meta-narrative)***
A collection of stories, customs, concepts, rules, values, traditions, beliefs.
The elements of any given narrative are typically woven together, like a vast tapestry, for a semblance of coherence.
But some internal contradictions generally do exist (see: narrative fiction).

***narrative fiction***
That subset of a tribal narrative elements that are "toxic" (aka "unpalatable") and which tend to be characteristic
for that given tribal society. Toxicity prompts non-members of the tribe to reject elements of the narrative fiction,
thereby increasing the reliability of the narrative fiction as marker of tribal identity.

***postmodernism***
the state of maximization of the victory of the tribal cognitive mode over the science cognitive mode

<br>

***Unpalatability (a.k.a toxicity)***
Unpalatable, or toxic, elements are those elements that would be rejected by science mode cognition.
There are two major categories of toxicity: logical inconsistencies and nonfalsifiable (or outright demonstrably false) statements of fact.

***Virtue***
Allegiance to the tribal narrative.

<br>

***Virtue signal***
Demonstration of allegiance to the tribal narrative.

***Equivocation***
An alteration in the definition of a word, phrase, or concept.
Equivocation comes in two categories: honest and dishonest. Honest form of equivocation is the product of science
mode, as definitions are updated in response to an expanded understanding of the world. The dishonest form of equivocation
is one of the central tools utilized by tribal cognitive mode for the incorporation of logical inconsistencies,
whereby a single argument or line of thought, references two (or more) conflicting definitions of the same word, phrase or concept
in a manner that obfuscates the conflict.
