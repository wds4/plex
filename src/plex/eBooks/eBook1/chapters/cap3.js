For those of you who like the distilled version, here it is. We start with the following observations:
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBoldSentence >Observation 1: Human beings demonstrate a remarkable ability for self-deception.</span>
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBoldSentence >Observation 2: Society is characterized by narrative.</span> Defined in the glossary.
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBoldSentence >Observation 3: Tribal narratives tend to be characterized by a core set of elements that are endorsed by insiders but rejected by outsiders.</span>
We will call this the <i>characteristic narrative</i> (or the <i>narrative fiction</i>) of the tribe.
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
To explain the above observations, we propose the following model:
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >The human condition is characterized by vulnerability to extortion.</span> By virtue of being born, we have enemies.
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >Therefore, we need allies.</span>
The need to belong is one of our greatest motivations. We would rather die than suffer the moral disapproval and rejection of our people.
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >Therefore, we organize ourselves into tribes.</span>
We need a way to distinguish tribal insiders from outsiders.
Once tribes exceed Dunbar's number, we can't keep track of everyone. Something like a uniform, but one that is not easy to take on or off.
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >Tribal narrative is a reliable marker of tribal identity.</span>
Much like a soldier's uniform, the primary purpose of narrative is to distinguish frined from foe; insider from outsider; us vs them.
(Secondary purpose is stratification of roles within the tribe.)
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >Adoption of the narrative must not be too easy.</span>
It must require work. There must be a way to demonstrate or prove the work was done.
The work needs to be difficult. The difficulty needs to be adjustable.
</div>

<i>The best way to accomplish these goals is for the narrative to be FALSE.</i>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >The narrative fiction is BATSHIT CRAZY (false) BY DESIGN.</span>
Fiction may be too strong of a word. Unpalatable.
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >The brain has several tools -- the COGNITIVE BLIND SPOT -- to help us accept the narrative fiction.</span>
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
<span class=eBookBold2Sentence >Proof of narrative happens by VIRTUE SIGNALING.</span>
Virtue signaling is also a mechanism for evolution and construction of the narrative fiction.
Virtue signals flow like waves through a society. The primary function of each wave is to serve as a litmus test to distinguish tribal members from non-members.
Each wave adds another layer of unpalatability to the narrative fiction. Insiders embrace the unpalatability; outsiders reject it.
</div>

<div class=eBookParagraphContainer >
For reasons discussed in this book, most of us are largely unaware of these processes within our own lives.
By the end of this book, you will come to understand the CBS as a wound. A physical scar on the brain. Largely self-inflicted.
A chief goal of this book is to teach how to recognize the occurrence and propagation of virtue signal from within your own tribe.
The inability to do so can have dire consequences for you as an individual as well as for society as a whole.
</div>

Life is mysterious because self deception is at the core of our search for meaning, virtue, belonging, and acceptance.
But we can at least unveil one part of the mystery:
Much like bitcoin's PoW, this self deception serves a clear, understandable, articulable, rational purpose.

We can eliminate the need for deception if we can find an alternate method to protect against extortion.

Self deception in service to the narrative is the highest form of tribal virtue.

By the end of this book you should be able to observe and recognize the narrative fiction and waves of virtue signaling
from within your own tribal narrative. There are two reasons you will want to do this. First, to protect yourself
from the ill effects of mental models of the world that are objectively wrong. Second, to recognize those instances
where the benefits of the narrative fiction (in terms of social cohension) have taken a globally pathologic turn.
Throughout history there have been societies that have mysteriously fallen apart; it may be conjectured that such catastrophes
could be the result of narrative fiction going awry. Other instances may have triggered genocides.

Of course, you'll also want to know when to take action, and what kind of action/response to take. When to embrace the narrative, when to oppose it,
and when to do something else.
