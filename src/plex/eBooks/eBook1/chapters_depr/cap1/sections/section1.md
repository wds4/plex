**A societal narrative (or meta-narrative)**
A collection of stories, customs, concepts, rules, values, traditions, beliefs.
The elements of any given narrative are typically woven together, like a vast tapestry, for a semblance of coherence.
But some internal contradictions generally do exist (see: narrative fiction).

**narrative fiction**
That subset of a tribal narrative elements that are "toxic" (aka "unpalatable") and which tend to be characteristic
for that given tribal society. Toxicity prompts non-members of the tribe to reject elements of the narrative fiction,
thereby increasing the reliability of the narrative fiction as marker of tribal identity.
